Notes on SPI:
Master:
- Two shift registers in Master and Slave
- To initiate communication cycle pull low on SS pin on slave
- To send data, master should generate required clock pulses on SCK line
- Data is shifted from master to slave on MOSI line
- After each data packet, the master will synch the slave by pulling high on SS line
- You have to control the SS line when you are the master
- To send data, write a byte to SPI Data Register SPDR
- When byte is written to SPDR, the clock generator starts
- After shifting one byte, the clock stops, setting end of tranmission flag SPIF in SPSR
- You cam eneable SPI interrupt by setting SPIE in SPCR register
- You can send byte again by writing it to SPDR or it will end the transmission by sending high on SS line
- The last incoming byte will be kept in the Buffer Register for later use

Slave:
-
